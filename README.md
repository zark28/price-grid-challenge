## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I am taking these challnges to revise my html css and js knowledge as i have been off coding foe a while.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Moving forward will like to focus more on grid css properties and mobile first work-flow
